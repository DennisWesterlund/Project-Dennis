        <p class="text"><h1>Right. I have just started this journey..</h1>  ...to be more precise, it's exactly 6 days ago now. 
            <br>The 9th of January more precisely. <br>As I'm writing this <em>(hello old me, I'm now adding it too the html-file)</em> it's now January <s>15th</s>16th
        </p>
        
        <p class="text"> <strong>Lets start at...</strong> <h2>Day 1</h2>
        </p><strong>January 9th</strong><br>
        Monday...<br>
        
        <p class="text">
             It all really started when I saw this ad for <em>Code Institute</em> on Instagram while I was scrolling and tending to my children.
             I entered the website and saw that they had a 5-day challange to see if you'd enjoy coding. I signed up and started then and there.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            So, I finished the introduction which covered basically the body, P and creating a page that says "Hello, World."
        </p>

        <p class="text"><h2>Day 2</h2></p>
            <strong>January 10th</strong><br>
            Tuesday.<br>
            
            I keep doing the CI daily lessons and finish it with 100% on the final multiple options quiz on try 1 out of 2. This is fun! I also look into if it's possible to start this seriously.
            </p>

            <p class="text"><h2>Day 3</h2></p>
            <strong>January 11th</strong><br>
            Wednesday.<br>
            
            The CI daily lessons provide me with a finished code in a console - I don't fully understand everything in it, 
            but I finish the assignments and again finish with 100% score on the multiple options quiz on try 1 out of 2.<br><br>
            Is this not just a pipedream?

            </p>

            <p class="text"><h2>Day 4</h2></p>
            <strong>January 12th</strong><br>
            Thursday.<br>
            I found a html YouTube guide <a href="https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc">from SuperSimpleDev,</a> which I follow up until lesson 3. <br>I know how to create buttons! 

            <br> <br>I finish the day 4 CI lesson the same way I've done the previous ones,  100% on the multiple choice quiz on try 1 out of 2.

            I keep up the research on CI. It costs â‚¬6500. Do i wanna commit or is there a better option? I find TOP and start the introduction.
            </p>

            <p class="text"><h2>Day 5</h2></p>
            <strong>January 13th</strong><br>
            Friday.<br>
            I keep following the YouTube guide from SuperSimpleDev and get too lesson 5, this is scary.<br>

First time I struggle on the CI challenge, they introduce JavaScript and I don't <s>fully understand</s> the @media syntax. <br> (Comment from future Dennis: You don't understand it at all, dummy.)<br><br>

I struggle a bit and finally ask for help in the CI slack channel. The solution was i had removed the class from the < i > and put it on the < sequence > which made no sense. Talk about overconfidence and a reality check.<br>

An employee of CI calls and wants too enroll me. <strong>Get hyped!</strong>...<br><br><br><br>

Later that night.. a seed of doubt.

            </p>

            <p class="text"><h2>Day 6</h2></p>
            <strong>January 14th</strong><br>
            Saturday.<br>
            Thinking about options. Discuss with my girlfriend other and rest of my family. Thinking hard. 

           <br> Luckily I find two fullstack devs in my WoW guild. What are the odds, huh? Pepper them with questions.

            <br> <br> <Strong>Later this evening, decision made.</Strong><br>

            I'm fully committing too TOP only.<br>
            I keep up with the TOP curriculum. Currently trying to understand CLI, GIT and GitHub.<br>
            <br>Reality check #2.
            </p>


            <p class="text"><h2>Day 7</h2></p>
            <strong>January 15th</strong><br>
            Sunday. <br>
            <em>This is going to be a long "blogpost" or whatever you want to call this. I'll explain below.</em><br><br>

            The first 6 days might not be 100% accurate timeline-wise since these days are mostly a blur of new concepts, new languages and a building anticipation mixed with gut wrenching fear and I'm writing this all down on day 7. <strong>Here we go:</strong><br>

<em>The first real diary-post.</em><br>

Begin my first own project. This website. I made a mock design while giving my oldest breakfast and so far<br>
<li>I've created the first 4 .html pages</li> <li> one .css</li> <li>I actually managed to get the 5 buttons created, styled and centered</li><br> with the font roboto from Google fonts and create a :hover that actually looks decent!<br>

I make the link to my GitHub, is it the correct link? I still have no idea. It's 02:29AM and my kids wake up in 3 hours. Pain. <br>

I start fleshing out the about.html, My-Journey.html which this semi-diary is going to occupate. I realize I haven't actually done any documentation about this journey so far (see the beginning of this day).<br> 

Anyway, I created the .html documents and the .css-file and the new dennis-project folder first through CLI commands (yay I still somehow managed to remember how to do that since yesterday).<br><br>

At this point I realize I need to get this project up on GitHub. I try the commands git commit, git push and nothing is working.<br>
Realize I need to redo the git, CLI  and GitHub lesson.<br><br>

I managed, stupidly, to upload the files on github.com manually onto a new repo. <br><br>

This doesn't solve the issue.<br>

I go back and read through the git lessons and manage to link them together with the new SSH-key.<br>

This creates a new folder inside the /repos/dennis-project/ called Dennis-project. Now i have to change all the <a href="link.html"> to the new dir.. damn. <br>


This is a lot to understand at once.<br> 
As I'm writing this <em>(Note from future Dennis: not the Dennis actually adding this too the .html, I'm here at 02:31, idiot. You wrote this at 3:30pm or some such)</em> I'm sitting on the couch, trying to talk to my girlfriend, play with my oldest son and think about what I need to do today as I've only put 1,5 hours into this today.<br><br> Right.<br> The boys and parents need dinner.<br>
<br>
Question: should I include the Google doc I'm typing this on onto GitHub, if so, how? <br>
Question 2: I have some pictures from the days which can illustrate the thought process of this decision I've made. <br>Should these go on GitHub as well? On the website, yes, how do you add a small pic (thumbnail) with a :hover or :active rule to make it bigger?<br>
<br>
It's only 4pm. I have too much excitement. Should I just stick with the TOP tonight or should I try to do the questions above for my own project?<br>

BEFORE I FORGET ME, START USING CODE COMMENTS ON WHAT YOU NEED TO GET A BETTER GRASP ON IN YOUR PROJECT.<br> <br>

Right - all caught up. This is present-time Dennis. It is now 02:33 AM - I'll answer myself and yes, just stick to TOP. Which I did. I actually got my first project;  the recipe. You can follow my progress on my GitHub, I think?<br>
I'm semi-happy with it. I spent the last 4 hours trying to figure out how to use :hover on < img > and why in the world my buttons wouldn't center. Fun times! <br>
<br>
Now atleast I'm starting to get going with this My-Journey page and hopefully I can look back at this and laugh at myself. Or cry. Only time will tell. <br> <br>

First 7 days, the first week. Is done.
